# Dungeon

A top down 2D tile-based roguelike game written in C and python using SDL2 and pygame respectively.
The purpose is mainly to improve my own coding skills and teach myself more about a lot of cool algorithms while making something fun in the process.

The project is thus far split in two. The python part is a random dungeon generator. It is mainly an exploration of different ways of randomly generating the basic layout of a classic dungeon(rooms and corridors). It is not intended to be playable, although it sort of is. Python is fast when you just want to test an algorithm. After testing things in python, the valuable insights gained can then be incorporated into the - hopefully - more "proper" C-version which is more of a game than a mashup of algorithms. 

## Getting Started

Copy the project folder or clone it.

### Prerequisites

So far, it only runs/compiles in linux. A future version might feature Windows support, but it's not high on my priority-list.

#### dungeon generator in python
python3.6
pygame for linux and python3

Run with:
python3 dungeon.py <width in pixels> <height in pixels> <recursive depth>
Example:
```
python3 dungeon.py 1300 700 4
```

## Testing
To play:
"L" resets all lists and spawns a new level
Keypad numbers 1-9 moves the blue "@" around

Upon reaching the green arrow going down, a new level is spawned.

#### basic game engine in C
SDL2 SDL_image and SDL_ttf libraries. All are to be found in standard linux repo.

Compile with:
make
Run with:
./dungeon <optional width> <optional height>
or
make run
