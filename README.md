# Dungeon

This is a random dungeon generator. It is a personal pet-project whose long term goals MIGHT end up in a roguelike game. For now, it is mainly an exploration of different ways of randomly generating the basic layout of a classic dungeon(rooms and corridors). It is not intended to be playable, although it sort of is.
