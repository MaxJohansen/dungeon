# Dungeon

This is a random dungeon generator. It is a personal pet-project whose long term goals MIGHT end up in a roguelike game. For now, it is mainly an exploration of different ways of randomly generating the basic layout of a classic dungeon(rooms and corridors). It is not intended to be playable, although it sort of is. 

## Getting Started

Copy the project folder or clone it.

### Prerequisites

python3.6
pygame for linux and python3

Run with:
python3 dungeon.py <width in pixels> <height in pixels> <recursive depth>
Example:
```
python3 dungeon.py 1300 700 4
```

### Screenshot using above example

## Testing
To play:
"L" resets all lists and spawns a new level
Keypad numbers 1-9 moves the blue "@" around

Upon reaching the green arrow going down, a new level is spawned.
